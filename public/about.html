<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I was born in California and raised in the suburbs of Chicago by a couple of truckers who did not get on well.
  After the divorce, my father, brother, and I settled in West Chicago, IL with my now stepmother and sister. 
  Being as my father was a repossessor and tow truck driver and my stepmother was... helpful, 
  I didn't see much of a future in school and promptly left it when I could. Due to lack of money, 
  I didn't consider furthering my education, and I was already able to find entry-level retail jobs through experience alone. 
  Sure, it wasn't much money, but I was able to get a room for myself and spend time with my friends, so I thought I was okay!

<p>Fast forward to a car accident that i wasn't insured for. I lost my lisence and couldn't get to work legally so with no idea what to do
  i moved in with my mom in california. she put me up for awhile and there was a year my wife and i were in our own place but man it's wild
   in cali. After 5 years out there we were able to pick up some skills and formed a business doing some entertainment at kids parties. 
   It was enough to help save up and keep us from starving and definitely a fun gig but life gets busy and we werent able to stay in cali.

<p>After moving to missouri with my parents after a few deaths in the family my  wife and i found ourselves in Kansas City.
  We both found jobs that could afford us a mostly comfortable lifestyle. But my job has started to turn into sales and whatever passion
   i may have had for it is very much wavering. I've dabbled in code here and there but after finding resources available through the public 
   library i find that i'm very much growing a passion for code. I find that im enjoying learning something and studying is satisfying.
   And the fact that i can hopefully reach the point of it being a career is exciting.
